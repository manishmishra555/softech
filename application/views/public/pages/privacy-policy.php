                        <li>You can see, analyze and edit most of your personal information by signing on to the site. Generally, we will not manually alter your personal information because it is very hard to verify your identity remotely. You must immediately update your personal information if it changes or is incorrect. Upon your inquiry, your account will be deactivated and we will eliminate your personal information from the site as soon as fairly possible, based on your account activity and by applicable law. However, after deactivation, we do hold personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent cheating, collect any payments owed, resolve conflicts, troubleshoot queries, assist with any inquiries, enforce our Galorebay Optix Pvt.

                        	<li>We work hard to protect Galorebay Optix Pvt. Ltd. and our users from proscribed access to or unlawful alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. </li>
                        	<li>We regulate access to personal information to Galorebay Optix Pvt. Ltd. representatives, contractors, and agents who need to know that information to process it for us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality duties and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these necessities. 
                        We take measures to guarantee that the personal data we collect is correct and relevant and we grant you the possibility to update your data through your account profile settings. We retain data as long as it is needed and appropriate for our operations.

                        <h3>Business Transfers:-</h3>
                        <p>As we continue to expand our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or trade units. In such events, customer data generally is one of the transferred business assets but persists subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice. Also, in the unlikely event that Galorebay Optix Pvt. Ltd. or essentially all of its assets are acquired, client information will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
